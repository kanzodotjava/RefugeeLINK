# User Story: Accept Refugees as Apprentices

## Description
As a mentor registered on the RefugeeLink app, I want to be able to accept refugees as apprentices, so that I can provide them with personalized mentorship and guidance to support their resettlement and integration process.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. As a registered mentor user, I should have access to a feature within the RefugeeLink app for accepting refugees as apprentices.
2. Upon accessing the "Accept Refugees as Apprentices" section, I should see a list of refugees who have expressed interest in being mentored by me.
3. Each refugee listing should include essential information such as their name, background, skills, interests, and any specific mentorship needs they have indicated.
4. I should have the option to review the information provided by each refugee and assess their suitability as an apprentice.
5. I should be able to select a refugee from the list and accept them as my apprentice by confirming their enrollment.
6. After accepting a refugee as my apprentice, the app should update the apprentice list to reflect the enrollment changes.
7. The accepted apprentice should receive a notification or confirmation message informing them of their successful enrollment as my apprentice.

## Notes
- Accepting refugees as apprentices allows mentors to establish a mentor-mentee relationship and provide personalized guidance and support.
- Clear communication of apprentice enrollment status updates helps refugees feel valued and motivated to actively engage in the mentorship process.

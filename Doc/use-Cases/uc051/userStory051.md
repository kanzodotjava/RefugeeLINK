# User Story: Ban or Verify Mentors as Admin

## Description
As an Admin responsible for maintaining the integrity and quality of the platform, I want to be able to ban or verify mentors on the website to ensure that only qualified and trustworthy individuals are providing mentorship to refugees.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. As an Admin, I should have access to a dashboard or interface where I can manage mentors' accounts.
2. I should be able to view a list of all registered mentors on the website.
3. For each mentor, I should have options to either ban or verify their account.
4. When I choose to ban a mentor, their account should be suspended, and they should no longer be able to access mentorship features.
5. When I choose to verify a mentor, their account should be marked as verified, indicating that they have been vetted and approved to provide mentorship.
6. I should receive a confirmation message after successfully banning or verifying a mentor.

## Notes

- The interface for managing mentors should be user-friendly and intuitive to use.
- It's essential to maintain clear communication with mentors regarding any changes to their account status.
- The verification process should include checks for credentials, qualifications, and background checks to ensure the safety and quality of mentorship provided.

# User Story: View Refugees Needing Mentorship

## Description
As a mentor registered on the RefugeeLink app, I want to be able to view a list of refugees who are in need of mentorship, so that I can offer my support and assistance to those who require it the most.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. As a registered mentor user, I should have access to a feature within the RefugeeLink app for viewing refugees in need of mentorship.
2. Upon accessing the "View Refugees Needing Mentorship" section, I should see a list of refugees who are seeking mentorship support.
3. Each refugee listing should include essential information such as their name, background, skills, interests, and any specific mentorship needs they have indicated.
4. I should have the option to click on a refugee's profile from the list to view more detailed information about their mentorship needs and background.
5. The app should provide clear navigation options for me to easily access the list of refugees needing mentorship from anywhere within the app.
6. If there are no refugees currently seeking mentorship, the app should display a message indicating that there are no refugees in need of mentorship at the moment.

## Notes
- The ability to view refugees in need of mentorship allows mentors to identify and reach out to individuals who could benefit from their guidance and support.
- Clear presentation of refugee profiles and mentorship needs helps mentors make informed decisions about offering mentorship to refugees with whom they share common interests or expertise.

# Use Case: UC023 - Select a Mentor

## Actors:

1. Refugee (primary actor)

## Preconditions:

1. The refugee is registered and logged into their RefugeeLink account.
2. The refugee has navigated to the "View Available Mentors" section within the RefugeeLink app.

## Flow of Events:
1. Refugee Views Mentor Profiles: The refugee navigates to the section of the app dedicated to viewing available mentors. The system displays profiles of available mentors.
2. Display Mentor Details: Each mentor's profile includes key details such as the mentor's name, area of expertise, languages spoken, and availability.
3. Refugee Filters Mentors: If desired, the refugee applies filters or uses search criteria to narrow down the list of mentors based on specific preferences such as area of expertise, language proficiency, or availability.
4. Refugee Selects a Mentor: The refugee browses through the filtered mentor profiles and selects one that aligns with their needs or interests.
5. View Detailed Mentor Profile: Upon selection, the system displays more detailed information about the mentor, including a more comprehensive biography, specific areas of expertise, and possibly reviews or ratings from previous mentees.
6. Initiate Contact or Note Interest: Depending on the app's functionality, the refugee either notes their interest in the mentor for future reference, initiates contact directly through the app, or prepares to apply for mentorship through a subsequent process.

## Alternative Flows:

1. No Mentors Match Criteria: If no mentors match the refugee's filtered criteria, the system displays a message indicating there are no mentors available that meet the specified requirements. The refugee is encouraged to adjust their search criteria or check back at a later time.

## Postconditions:

1. The refugee has successfully identified and selected a mentor they are interested in learning more about or contacting for potential mentorship.

## Notes:

1. This use case focuses on the selection and initial exploration of potential mentors, not on the application process for mentorship.
2. Ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly interface for viewing and selecting mentors is crucial for facilitating successful connections between refugees and mentors.

# User Story: Toggle Approval Status of Students in Formations

## Description
As an organization responsible for managing formations within the RefugeeLink app, I want to be able to toggle the approval status of students directly from the student list within the formation, simplifying the process of managing student enrollment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. As an organization user, I should have access to a feature within the RefugeeLink app to manage student enrollment in formations.
2. Upon accessing the student list for a formation, I should see a table or list displaying all students enrolled in the formation.
3. Each student entry in the list should include essential information such as the student's name, background, skills, and current approval status.
4. Next to each student entry, there should be a toggle or checkbox indicating the current approval status (e.g., approved or not approved).
5. I should be able to click on the toggle or checkbox next to a student's entry to change their approval status.
6. If I toggle the approval status to "approved," the student should be considered officially enrolled in the formation.
7. If I toggle the approval status to "not approved," the student's enrollment should be rejected, and they should be notified accordingly.
8. The student list should dynamically update to reflect changes in approval status.
9. The organization user should be able to review and update approval status for multiple students in the formation efficiently.
10. The system should provide appropriate feedback or notifications to confirm changes in approval status and inform students of enrollment status updates.

## Notes
- Allowing organizations to toggle the approval status of students directly from the student list streamlines the process of managing student enrollment in formations.
- Clear communication of approval status changes ensures transparency and helps students understand their enrollment status in formations.
